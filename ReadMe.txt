There is 2 users, one is me from my laptop, second is also me from my PC, i really don' know why my PC name is 'wspaliah :) '
This is a project I started for fun and for learning new skills.
Project is unfinished and probably have a lot of bugs.
I am preparing live version of the project, but firstly I want to make it usable, right now it doesn't have any use value.
In the  future many of the SQL code in PHP scripts will be replaced with stored procedures, and after I learn how to make my code reusable I will organize my files better and I hope that the scripts will be easier to understand.
I know that I am not using best practices for many things, but right now,  I am happy just beacuse it works.
