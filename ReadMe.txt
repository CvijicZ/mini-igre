There are 2 users, one is me from my laptop, second is also me from my PC, i really don' know why my PC name is 'wspaliah :) '
This is a project I started for fun and for learning new skills.
Project is unfinished and probably have a lot of bugs.
I am preparing live version of the project, but firstly I want to make it usable, right now it doesn't have any use value.
I know that I am not using best practices for many things, but right now,  I am happy just beacuse it works.
